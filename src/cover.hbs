        <p>Howdy! My name is Shane. Welcome to my site. I am a graduate of the Rochester Institute of Technology with a Bachelors of Science in Information Technology (yup that's a mouthful isn't it?). </p>
        <p> Over the past year I have been working with <a href="#" class="link mcd">MCD Partners</a> as an Associate Web Developer. I have worked on numerous projects for our biggest client, <a href="#" class="link discover">Discover</a>, as well as other agency projects with clients like <a href="#" class="link sling">Sling TV</a> and <a href="#" class="link tiaa">TIAA-Charitable</a>. Currently, I am seeking a new position to further my career in web development.</p>
        <p>I was born, raised, and currently live in Fairport, NY. I love to play Soccer, Hockey, Basketball, and just about any other sport you can imagine. I also enjoy fishing, kayaking, and exploring. I am an avid (read: absolute maniac) fan of the Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres.</p>
        <p>I also am a photography hobbyist. Check out my gallery here.</p>
