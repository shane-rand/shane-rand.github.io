    <h1>Discover It&copy; Credit Card Redesign</h1>

      <p><h2>Time:</h2></p>
      <p>5 weeks</p>
      <p><h2>Goal:</h2></p>
      <p> Completely overhaul Discover's 4 main credit card pages, which range from a generic Discover it card to more specific Student, Travel, and NHL Cards.</p>
      <p><h2>Details:</h2></p>
      <p>All 4 pages share similar design elements, with a standard marquee + card rotation to kick off the page.</p>
      </p>A large mid-page call out asks the user to compare Discover's cards with other major brands. This crafty module uses css gradients to create a fade out, and the chart is active html. Discover supports IE7, and so images were used in place of the css gradients to achieve a similar effect. A common color theme is present throughout, and rotates along with the marquee. </p>
      <p> 4 grid feature module which further introduces the capabilities of a Discover credit card. These pages were built primarily upon Bootstrap grid layout with some custom functionality here and there.</p>
      <p> These pages are completely responsive, and are 100% ADA compliant for users with disabilities. </p>
      <p> Javascript objects were primarily used to easily control the colors of various sections on each page.</p>

      <p><h2>Time:</h2></p>
      <p>2 weeks</p>
      <p><h2>Goal:</h2></p>
      <p> Create two email layouts to send to prospective donors and current donors.</p>
      <p><h2>Details:</h2></p>
      <p>Each email shares a similar layout. Copy is relevant to the target audience.</p>
      </p>A streaking vertical line guides the recipient along, making sure to "stop" at each item in the email.</p>
      <p>This project enjoys bold colors that are shared with TIAA Charitable's site.</p>
      <p> Both emails are 100% responsive, as much as Emails can be, and were tested with Litmus. Almost every email client that is available in Litmus for testing displays correctly.</p>
