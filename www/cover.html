        <p>Howdy! My name is Shane. Welcome to my site. I am a graduate of the Rochester Institute of Technology with a Bachelors of Science in Information Technology (yup that's a mouthful isn't it?). My primary focus is in Web Technologies with languages like HTML, SASS, JS + JQuery, PHP, and a host of frameworks. I am also proficient with Grunt and handlebars. I use GIT for code management and JIRA for issue tracking. I am always open to learning new languages and frameworks.</p>
        <p> Over the past year I have been working with <a href="#" class="link mcd">MCD Partners</a> as an Associate Web Developer. I have worked on numerous projects for our biggest client, <a href="#" class="link discover">Discover</a>, as well as other agency projects with clients like <a href="#" class="link sling">Sling TV</a> and <a href="#" class="link tiaa">TIAA-Charitable</a>. Currently, I am seeking a new position to further my career in web development.</p>
        <p>I was born, raised, and currently live in Fairport, NY. I love to play Soccer, Hockey, Basketball, and just about any other sport you can imagine. I also enjoy fishing, kayaking, and exploring. I am an avid (read: absolute maniac) fan of the Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres.</p>

    <h1>Discover Credit Card Redesign</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="overlay-body">
    <div class="col-md-6 overlay-copy">
      <div class="section-header overlay-overview-content"></div>
      <p>The goal of this project for Discover was to completely overhaul its 4 main credit card pages, which range from a generic Discover it card to more specific Student, Travel, and NHL Cards.</p>
      <p>All 4 pages share similar design elements, with a standard marquee + card rotation to kick off the page.</p>
      </p>After some in depth information, a large mid-page call out asks the user to compare Discover's cards with other major brands. This crafty module uses css gradients to create a fade out, and the chart is active html. Discover supports IE7, and so images were used in place of the css gradients to achieve a similar effect. </p>
      <p> These pages are completely responsive, and are 100% ADA compliant for users with disabilities. </p>
